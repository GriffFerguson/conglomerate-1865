            <h1>Welcome to Conglomerate 1865!</h1>
            <p>
                In the post-Civil War era, American industries innovated and grew to achieve immense success. Corporations grew, remote areas became connected, not a single industry was left untouched.
                However, there's still money left to earn.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's where you come in. You are a wealthy investor, alongside the likes of J.P Morgan and Cornelius Vanderbilt with the goal to gain total control of America's industries. The people sitting around you are your competitors, and you must bid on their assets, make smarter investments, gain more capital than they do, and hope you have better luck.
            </p>
            <p>There are 5 actions for you to perform to manage your money:
                <br>- <b>Buy</b> a new asset: the small black dots on the map are far from fully-developed, but could hold lots of money for lucky investors
                <br>- <b>Invest</b> in an existing asset: you've gotta start somewhere; put some money into an existing business, and get some passive income <b>Note: investing costs 20% of the asset's normal value</b>
                <br>- <b>Bid</b> on a competitor's asset: it takes aggression to gain control, perhaps a monetary incentive will help you get control of assets <b>Note: a 2% fee is applied to all bids, rejected or not</b>
                <br>- <b>Sell</b> an owned asset: sometimes it's best to abandon ship, and in that case sell-away!
                <br>- <b>Hire</b> workers: your owned business won't grow by itself; if you stop hiring workers, your business's growth will crawl to a standstill <b>Note: each worker requires a $5000 downpayment and a $150 recurring fee</b>
                <br>Start off by investing. Get some passive income, then start buying up assets.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                Use the icons on the host device to measure a good investment and a bad investment. The value of an asset/investment constantly fluctuates; a green icon means the value is increasing, a red icon means it's decreasing; the size of the dot indicates how much the item is worth, with larger dots meaning more value.
            </p> -->
            <p>Now enough with the instructions! You've got $10,000,000 and a large set of investments; get to work!</p>
